# Mystery Hits Factory — Stream Clipper

Drops in a Whatnot **Pokemon TCG** stream recording, picks the best moments (chase pulls, viewer interactions, big reactions), renders captioned clips per platform, posts them to TikTok / Instagram / Facebook.

There are two flows:

- **Local clip flow** — you drop a Whatnot stream into `input/`, the agent finds the best moments and posts clips. Manual, on-demand.
- **Daily generator flow** — when no fresh stream exists, an AI picks a content theme (live promo / hobby tip / brand intro / value-add) and produces a 12-second captioned video. Runs unattended on a daily cron via GitHub Actions.

## How the clip flow works

```
input/stream.mp4
    │
    ▼
[ ffmpeg: audio loudness peaks ]
    │
    ▼
[ Whisper: word-level transcript ]
    │
    ▼
[ Claude: pick top 3 moments — pack pulls, viewer interactions, reactions ]
    │
    ▼
[ Remotion: render 9 clips (3 moments × 3 platforms, each with its own end card) ]
    │
    ▼
[ Upload-Post: schedule to TikTok / IG / FB with platform-specific captions ]
```

## One-time setup

### 1. Install ffmpeg

The clipper shells out to `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for audio analysis and compression. Both must be on your PATH.

**Windows:**
```
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```
Then close & reopen your terminal so PATH refreshes. Verify:
```
ffmpeg -version
```

### 2. Install npm deps

```
cd clipper && npm install
cd ../remotion && npm install
cd ../remotion && npx remotion browser ensure
```

### 3. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repo root and fill in:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — for Whisper transcription
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for moment ranking
- `UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY` and `UPLOAD_POST_USER` — your Upload-Post profile that has Mystery Hits Factory's TikTok / IG / FB connected (likely a different profile from Gold Touch List)
- `WHATNOT_HANDLE`, `TIKTOK_HANDLE`, `INSTAGRAM_HANDLE`, `FACEBOOK_PAGE` — already prefilled with `mysteryhitsfactory` / `mystery.hits.factory`

## Running

Drop a stream recording into `input/`:
```
input/
  my-stream.mp4
```

Then from `clipper/`:
```
cd clipper
npm run clip
```

The newest video in `input/` gets processed. To target a specific file:
```
npm run clip -- --input=path/to/file.mp4
```

To do a full render but skip posting:
```
npm run clip:dry
```

## Output

```
output/
  my-stream/
    clip-01-tiktok.mp4
    clip-01-instagram.mp4
    clip-01-facebook.mp4
    clip-02-tiktok.mp4
    ...
clipper/work/
  my-stream/
    audio.mp3            # compressed audio sent to Whisper
    transcript.json      # full Whisper output
    moments.json         # what Claude picked
```

## Daily generator flow

For the days you don't drop a stream, the daily generator keeps your feeds active.

```
[ Claude picks theme based on day-of-week rotation ]
    │   live-promo / hobby-tip / live-promo / value-add / live-promo / hobby-tip / intro
    ▼
[ Claude writes hook + body + cta + image prompt + caption ]
    │
    ▼
[ DALL-E 3: abstract collector aesthetic — holo foils, sealed-pack shapes, mystery boxes (NO Pokemon characters/logos/Nintendo IP) ]
    │
    ▼
[ Remotion: 12s captioned 9:16 video — hook → body → cta ]
    │
    ▼
[ Upload-Post: same video to TikTok / IG / FB with platform-specific captions ]
```

Run locally:
```
cd clipper
npm run daily:dry   # generate + render, no post
npm run daily       # full run with posts
```

### Scheduled deployment (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/mhf-daily.yml` workflow runs the daily generator every day at 17:00 UTC (1 PM ET).

To activate it:

1. Create a GitHub repo (private is fine) and push:
   ```
   gh repo create mystery-hits-factory --private --source=. --push
   ```
   (or `git remote add origin ...; git push -u origin main`)

2. Add 4 repository secrets at `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY`
   - `UPLOAD_POST_USER` — the Upload-Post profile that has Mystery Hits Factory's TikTok / IG / FB connected

3. The schedule fires automatically. To test before waiting for tomorrow, go to `Actions → MHF Daily Post → Run workflow`, optionally with `dry_run: true`.

## Tuning

If a clip comes out wrong, the fix is usually one of:

- **Wrong moment picked** → edit `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `clipper/src/detect/rank.ts`
- **Hook text feels off** → edit how `hookPhrase` is generated (also in `rank.ts`)
- **End card / caption tone wrong on one platform** → edit `clipper/src/config.ts`
- **Captions too small / wrong position** → edit `remotion/src/StreamClip.tsx`
- **Want more or fewer clips per stream** → `SETTINGS.momentsPerStream` in `clipper/src/config.ts`
- **Daily promo content feels generic / off-voice** → edit `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `clipper/src/generate/plan.ts`
- **Daily theme rotation wrong (too much promo / not enough)** → edit `pickThemeForDay` in `clipper/src/generate/plan.ts`
- **Daily video styling** → edit `remotion/src/PromoCard.tsx`
- **AI image looks wrong** → tighten the imagePrompt rules in `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `plan.ts`

## Limits

- Whisper API has a 25MB file cap. The clipper compresses audio to 24kbps mono — that holds up to ~2 hours of stream. Longer streams will need chunked transcription (not in v1).
- Currently English transcription only.
- No music, no auto-music. (Per design.)
